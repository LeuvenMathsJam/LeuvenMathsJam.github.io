Welcome to our (collaborative website) for the [Leuven MathsJam](https://mathsjam.com/cities/leuven/). Our revival kick-off was on Tuesday 2022-02-15 ([Write-Up incoming soon here](https://aperiodical.com)) at 20:00 and we will meet again every second to last Tuesday of each month. 

# Physical Meetup

We meetup every **second to last Tuesday of the month** in [OPEK](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/94781952)

Everyone welcome, no matter maths skills, interest, origin or native language. We try to be as inclusive as possible. For children under 12 yo we ask they are accompanied by an interested adult.

# Digital Meetup

We also meet digitallly using the mathematically intersting [Signal Private Messenger App](https://signal.org/download). You can find us using the link below or by scanning the equally valid QR code.
