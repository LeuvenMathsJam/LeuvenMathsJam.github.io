# LeuvenMathsJam.github.io
Site for the Leuven [MathsJam](https://mathsjam.com). Our first kick-off was on Tuesday 15/02/2022 at 20:00 and we will meet again every second to last Tuesday of each month. Stay tuned for more details on venue location.

Everyone welcome, no matter maths skills, interest, origin or native language.

We also meet digitallly using the mathematically intersting [Signal Private Messenger App](https://signal.org/download). You can find us using the link below or by scanning the equally valid QR code.
